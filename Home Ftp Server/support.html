		<b>Support</b><br>
		<br>
			Both Home and Simple Series freeware products has
			support page at <a href="http://downstairs.dnsalias.net/products.html">
			downstairs.dnsalias.net</a> on my home computer running the Home
			Web Server. Page contains lots of information about these
			products and also support forum where you may find answers
			to questions you may have or share idea of what would be nice
			to have feature on the products in future.<br>
			<br>
			As the support page is being served here with the latest information,
			I've secondary download page at <a href="http://www.kolumbus.fi/ari.pikivirta">
			another place</a>, which is always online and even all the 
			information cannot be found there, the product installer packages
			are always updated there also.<br>
			<br>

		<b>Updates</b><br>
		<br>
			Even most of the products do have internet update possibility,
			it's sometimes very nice to see what has changed. Everything
			changed is added into the revision history document published
			below the actual product download link. In case there will
			be big changes to implement into the product, there is always
			<i>beta</i> revision available for download for sime time to
			make sure everything that is changed didn't cause any harm
			to previous functionality and to confirm the new features
			functionality before the actual revision is released as final.
			This is also because the internet update will after this 
			use the final build.<br>
			<br>
